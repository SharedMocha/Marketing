Share recipes, funny pics of your clients pets, quotes that you love (about anything), blogs etc. 
This gets people on your page and thinking about you and your services. Just be YOU in your posts. They do not have to be about your business.
And having a mailing list and sending out regular emails is equally as effective for the same reason.

Marketing and how chefs are managing multiple diets with the same menu (how not to miss something)
Scalability, hiring your first helper, passive income, managerial stuff when you‚Äôre trying to grow your business from grassroots.
 I think a big one is scaling appropriately, and focusing on the one thing you excel at, rather than try to spread out ‚Äúdoing all the things and being someone for everyone‚Äù would be great.
 How aboutmenu planning? Some of us create individual menus, some post a menu online and let clients choose and some do a combination of both. It would be interesting to discuss pros and cons of each approach.
 best price for a meal
I am so horrified! Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone! I have a client to whom I give several options for her menu each week. She chose #1 and #6 so what did I prepare for her? #1 and #5 üò≥. I obviously transposed the 5 and 6 and she was clearly bummed out. I gave her a 50% discount on the entire service and just feel stupid! **Has anyone else done this? Is the 50% discount enough? I‚Äôm so embarrassed!
*anyone here get a client who swears they are easy to please, and they turn out to be the exact opposite? UGH. Please tell me I am not alone.
  ** It is very typical: some answer the client survey " I am not fussy. I love everything. I will eat anything and everything " and then it is a series of..."i don't like salmon, I don't like pasta, I don't like tomatoes etc" When I hear "I love everything " I know that there will be trouble
Does anyone have a weekly client service agreement form I could look at? Trying to develop and don't know exactly where to start
  no https on websites --- (http://kristinmccaignutrition.com/personal-chef-services) (http://kristinmccaignutrition.com/cookbook)
master menu - ask client 2 weeks before if they wanna changr from their customer menu--mostly they wont even see--so i go with what i have,
 menu-approval before creating menu ..somedont care
 ai to create custom menu based on their likes and dislikes...
 finding customer -- u will have a customer for yers and they stop for various reasons..and u need to start froms scratch
 people have taken advantage of you. ----(add consulting charge to discuss menus)Does this happen to anyone besides me? This is the third time this year. Baby Shower, Bridal Shower and Appetizer/Dessert party: phone & email communication first, a few ideas shared...could you email them? Yes... deposit not received for event, communication back...is there a problem? Nothing. Only to look into it further (live in a big small town) and find they just wanted menu ideas and FREE expertise...grrrr. Help!
  ***put a process like talk,confirm,deposit...etc...
 *My local USPCA chapter is great - we have a running email chain where we can send out referrals when we have people that we can‚Äôt help.

 oyd II I've been so frustrated trying to reach out and get someone to call me to discuss. My employees have had so much trouble using Moderneal due to this.

 Thumbback  -->
 Hello chef, have any of you used "Thumbtack" to get some leads? If yes, what was your experience like and what do you think of it? Thank you!
 ***Terrible. I used it recently and they make you pay an amount of money up front and then use it like a debit for when you respond to a lead. I had one response after several weeks of attempts and I was charged $18 just because the person responded back - it did not get anywhere.
 *** Cooking lesson inquiries are almost always not worth it. I have gotten a couple private events through it, but make sure you set your prices so you weed out the people looking for the deal of a lifetime. With the changes they made they charge for leads up front but you get a refund if they don't respond. They charge based on the budget for an event, so if it's a dinner party it might be $30 in my area to respond, cooking lesson might be just a few bucks. It seems the last few months with the changes they made I get more legit leads, but they are far and few between.
 ***Did not work at all for me, but I understand it has delivered for others
 ***I've had a lot of success with Thumbtack, and they're still tweaking their system. It's hard to come up with a "one size fits all" process. I have noticed a sharp decline in contacts over the past month which is not necessarily a bad thing since the low ball inquiries are being weeded out. I don't mind paying $30 for a $1200 dinner party like the one I did Saturday. Most of my referrals come from clients, but Thumbtack has filled in a few holes on my calendar.
 ***Amazing. It's where most of my business has come from! I definitely have to Wade through the requests though 
 ***I just now booked a Thumbtack dinner for 8 at $75/plate for a fee of $26. Not a bad return on investment.
 *** I use it but sparengly... their fees has increased a lot and there are numerous inquiries looking for really cheap chefs so you have to pick and choose what jobs to bid on.
 *** I‚Äôve been using for 5 years, it works for me! With on client I started a cooking demonstration for just 1 time a month, than 2, 3 times and know I‚Äôm on my 4th times a month.

**yelp
 The only category available for personal chefs that I could found was ‚ÄúEvent Planning and Services‚Äù
 TBH- I would save the ad dollars for better use like Google ADWORDS, FB, IG and being on TV as often as possible.
 This is frustrating, I agree. I get a lot of catering inquiries and have to explain I can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt transport prepared food, etc.
 Paired with aggressive calls from Yelp asking why I stopped advertising with them üôÑ ugh
 I've made my position clear regarding the Yelp crime family. But it's a free country... until convicted. üßê
 Yelp should be destroyed
