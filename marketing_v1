Explaining above 4 items-
**Strategy 1- Get home cooks onboarded** -How ??????

Use the excel we have and refer to comments section and see if he/she is willing to sell food.
If so, reach out to them and start onboarding.

Based on gathered stats and counties- we estimate below counties are good start -start with **alameda**,**riverside**

ALAMDEA - 1508 supporters // 61 comments 
Sacramento - 1180 //31 comments
Santa Clara - 1140 //31 commentts

*Expected output from this task*-
In an excel need names,contacts,ethencity,age,region they server and if he/she already selling food today. We need if they like to give classes,dinein,takeout or delviery.



**Strategy 2- Get customers**
This is broad and large segment to cover.  Again we will start with excel and reach out to people who have comments saying they love
to buy food or something like this is helpful for me.

*Expected output from this task*-
In an excel need names,contacts,ethencity,age,region they server and if he/she already selling food today along with their needs like classes,dinein,takeout,delivery


**Strategy 3- Get more customers**
This is hard and we need to figure out which segment,age group we need to target in different regions.
DO NOT USE THIS WITHOUT COMPLETING ABOVE 2 as they will decide this.

Approaches ?
0.) Write blogs about AB 626 and start promoting using mini videos
1.) To gain customers -> Use existing customer base to take vidoes or share content thus making them  key players. We can use thse folks to be 
tech gurus for home cooks where they will help in setup and selling.Ask people to share videos or we prmote them (you might consider running a contest that asks users to submit content in order to win )
2.) To gain customers and chefs -<  CREATE actionable content ->Generate and share content that cretes value to customers oe something that they can share with others.
Ex- Health tips,cooking videos etc,First time cook videos to inspire others, OR INTERVIEW with home cooks.
Use the buzz surrounding our new product or service and tap into millennials’ propensity to share things they find interesting on social media.
Like healthy tip that we create for them to like or share
** DIY segment of the marketplace craves tangible ideas that include step-by-step advice.
3.) create  high-quality video.Like nice cooking video
4.) Segment your millennial markets.
Rather than thinking about which generation you’re targeting, think about which person you’re trying to reach. Knowing what your specific customers watch and where they consume their media is much more useful than using an assumption based on how long they’ve been alive.
6.) creating a rewarding mechanisam - loyalty programs, recognition events and special access to sales and other promotional events.
7.)  Support a worthy cause with your business.
Ex- we support home cooks and local communitiets, or we support local food back. Evey dollar spent goes to local food bank. or we fight no plastic by using reusable containers.
